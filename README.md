# LQGGarbledCircuits
In this repository, C++ code is used to run an example of a LQG controller using garbled circuits. The garbled circuits were achieved using [emp-toolkit](https://github.com/emp-toolkit) code, which can be downloaded using the command <br/>
wget https://goo.gl/wmt4KB -O install.sh && bash install.sh  <br/>

This example is done on data used for controlling the temperature of a bulidng, and was gotten from https://github.com/andreea-alexandru/LQG-with-LabHE.
